/**
 * Block timestamps for the account's events, answered from bulk data.
 *
 * ## Why this exists (read before adding any chain read keyed on a note)
 *
 * The account model shows a date next to every deposit, withdrawal and exit.
 * Until this module, that date came from a viem getBlock call with the note's block number,
 * issued once per pool account, per child and per ragequit, at login and after
 * every transaction. Each request's argument was a block number taken from this
 * user's own notes, sent from this user's IP to the RPC provider, and the same
 * block numbers are public in the pool's event log. The provider could therefore
 * join "this client asked about blocks B1..Bn" with "the pool emitted events in
 * B1..Bn" and learn exactly which deposits belong to this client. L2BEAT lists
 * this as "On login, the app performs block lookups for each deposit".
 *
 * The rule: no request leaving the app may carry a value derived from one
 * user's notes. Every client fetches the SAME bulk data and answers its own
 * questions in memory.
 *
 * ## Where the timestamps come from
 *
 * 1. The SDK's own event scan. `AccountService.initializeWithEvents` fetches
 *    every Deposited / Withdrawn / Ragequit log of every pool through the
 *    hypersync proxy, and that proxy returns `blockTimestamp` on each log
 *    (viem keeps unknown fields). `installBlockTimestampCapture` in
 *    `dataService.ts` records them as the scan runs. Zero extra requests, and
 *    the request stream is identical for every user of a pool.
 * 2. This session's own confirmations. A deposit or exit is broadcast by the
 *    user's wallet, a withdrawal is confirmed from bulk block data
 *    (`relayedReceipt.ts`); either way the flow knows the transaction just
 *    landed and seeds an approximate timestamp for it so the new row is dated
 *    immediately. The exact value replaces it on the next scan.
 *
 * 3. Derived from neighbours. The RPC dates only part of the rows in a range
 *    (the proxy completes them from the hypersync query API, see
 *    `logTimestampFill.ts`, but a custom endpoint or a fill that ran out of
 *    time leaves gaps). A block between two recorded blocks of the same chain
 *    is placed by linear interpolation; outside the recorded span, by the
 *    chain's mean block time over the span, capped at now. Anchors sit a few
 *    hundred blocks apart on mainnet, so the error is seconds, well under what
 *    a history row shows. `resolveEventTimestampSource` says which path fired.
 *    A custom endpoint dates no row at all; those chains get anchors fetched
 *    for blocks the chain picks (head, deployment block, bisection midpoints),
 *    see `blockAnchors.ts`, so this path still has something to interpolate.
 *
 * Anything none of the three knows stays `undefined` and renders as "-".
 * Unknown is strictly better than a lookup.
