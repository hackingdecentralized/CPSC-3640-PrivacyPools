# Privacy Pool Core SDK

A TypeScript SDK for interacting with the Privacy Pool protocol. This SDK provides cryptographic utilities, proof generation, account management, and contract interactions for Privacy Pool integration.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @0xbow/privacy-pools-core-sdk
# or
yarn add @0xbow/privacy-pools-core-sdk
# or
pnpm add @0xbow/privacy-pools-core-sdk
```

## Setup

1. Install dependencies by running `pnpm install`
2. Build the SDK by running `pnpm build`

## Usage

### Initialization

```typescript
import { PrivacyPoolSDK, Circuits } from '@0xbow/privacy-pools-core-sdk';

// In Node.js — set browser: false to load artifacts from the filesystem
const circuits = new Circuits({ browser: false });

// In the browser — the default (browser: true) uses fetch
// const circuits = new Circuits();

const sdk = new PrivacyPoolSDK(circuits);
```

### Commitment Proofs

```typescript
const commitmentProof = await sdk.proveCommitment(value, label, nullifier, secret);
const isValid = await sdk.verifyCommitment(commitmentProof);
```

### Withdrawal Proofs

```typescript
const withdrawalProof = await sdk.proveWithdrawal(commitment, withdrawalInput);
const isValid = await sdk.verifyWithdrawal(withdrawalProof);
```

### Key Derivation

The SDK derives deterministic master keys from a BIP-39 mnemonic phrase using `generateMasterKeys`. These keys are used to generate per-deposit and per-withdrawal nullifiers and secrets.

```typescript
import { generateMasterKeys, generateDepositSecrets, generateWithdrawalSecrets } from '@0xbow/privacy-pools-core-sdk';

const { masterNullifier, masterSecret } = generateMasterKeys(mnemonic);

const depositSecrets = generateDepositSecrets(
  { masterNullifier, masterSecret },
  scope,
  index,
);

const withdrawalSecrets = generateWithdrawalSecrets(
  { masterNullifier, masterSecret },
  label,
  index,
);
```

### Account Recovery

The `AccountService` reconstructs on-chain account state from a mnemonic by scanning deposit, withdrawal, and ragequit events.

```typescript
import { AccountService, DataService } from '@0xbow/privacy-pools-core-sdk';

const { account, legacyAccount, errors } = await AccountService.initializeWithEvents(
  dataService,
  { mnemonic },
  pools,
);
```

#### Incomplete Scopes

A non-empty `errors` array means one or more pools failed to load. Reconstructed
state for those scopes is **absent, not empty** — the account may hold notes that
are not visible, so treating the scope as having no accounts will understate the
next deposit index and produce a deposit that later reconstructions cannot find.

Check status before acting on a scope:

```typescript
account.getScopeStatus(scope); // 'complete' | 'incomplete' | 'not-loaded'
account.isScopeComplete(scope); // true only for 'complete'
account.getIncompleteScopes(); // scopes whose last load failed
```

Block deposits and withdrawals for any scope that is not `complete`.
`createDepositSecrets(scope)` without an explicit index throws for such a scope
rather than guessing; pass an explicit index only in recovery flows. Status is
stored on the account, so it survives persisting and restoring it.

To retry the failed pools, pass **both** services returned by the original call:

```typescript
const retry = await AccountService.initializeWithEvents(
  dataService,
  { service: account, legacyService: legacyAccount },
  pools,
);
```

Omitting `legacyService` reconstructs the retried scopes without migration
discovery, which silently omits migration-derived accounts.

#### Empty Nodes

`account.getSpendableCommitments()` returns the latest decrypted commitment of each account. By default (`includeEmptyNodes: true`) the result includes **empty (zero-value), migrated, and ragequit** nodes alongside spendable ones, so callers can see the full decrypted state.

To restore the spendable-only behavior — returning only commitments with a non-zero value whose account has not been ragequit or migrated — set `includeEmptyNodes: false`:

```typescript
const { account } = await AccountService.initializeWithEvents(
  dataService,
  { mnemonic },
  pools,
  { includeEmptyNodes: false },
);
```

The same option can be passed when constructing an `AccountService` directly:

```typescript
const account = new AccountService(dataService, { mnemonic, includeEmptyNodes: false });
```

> Note: when `includeEmptyNodes` is `true`, `getSpendableCommitments()` may return commitments that are not actually spendable (zero-value, migrated, or ragequit). Filter on `value` / account flags before attempting to spend.

### Contract Interactions

```typescript
const contracts = sdk.createContractInstance(rpcUrl, chain, entrypointAddress, privateKey);
```

## Mnemonic Security

The SDK does **not** provide a `generateMnemonic` utility. Use a trusted BIP-39 library (e.g. `@scure/bip39` or `viem/accounts`) to generate mnemonic phrases externally.

- **Never hardcode** mnemonics in source code or configuration files.
- **Never log or transmit** mnemonics in plaintext.
- **Store mnemonics** using OS-level secure storage (e.g. OS keychain, encrypted vault) — never in browser localStorage or unencrypted files.
- **Do not reuse** a single mnemonic across unrelated applications. A compromised mnemonic exposes all derived keys and the funds they control.
- The mnemonic is the **sole root of all derived keys**. Loss of the mnemonic means permanent loss of access to all associated commitments and funds.

## Circuit Artifact Integrity

The SDK verifies **every** downloaded circuit artifact (wasm, vkey, zkey) against expected SHA-256 digests. Artifacts without a registered hash are rejected at load time.

| Artifact | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| `commitment.wasm` | `254d2130607182fd6fd1aee67971526b13cfe178c88e360da96dce92663828d8` |
| `commitment.vkey` | `7d48b4eb3dedc12fb774348287b587f0c18c3c7254cd60e9cf0f8b3636a570d8` |
| `commitment.zkey` | `494ae92d64098fda2a5649690ddc5821fcd7449ca5fe8ef99ee7447544d7e1f3` |
| `withdraw.wasm` | `36cda22791def3d520a55c0fc808369cd5849532a75fab65686e666ed3d55c10` |
| `withdraw.vkey` | `666bd0983b20c1611543b04f7712e067fbe8cad69f07ada8a310837ff398d21e` |
| `withdraw.zkey` | `2a893b42174c813566e5c40c715a8b90cd49fc4ecf384e3a6024158c3d6de677` |

You can independently verify these against the committed artifacts:

```bash
shasum -a 256 packages/circuits/trusted-setup/final-keys/*.{vkey,zkey}
shasum -a 256 packages/circuits/build/*/*_js/*.wasm
```
