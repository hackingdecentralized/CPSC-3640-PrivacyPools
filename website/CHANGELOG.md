# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.16.2] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- USDT deposits no longer fail after an earlier approval landed without its deposit. A leftover allowance is zeroed before approving, and Safe batches always zero it first (#249)
- After a full withdrawal, the success screen names the pool account that was spent, instead of "PA-undefined" or a different account (#250)

## [2.16.1] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- Withdrawals from the BSC BNB pool no longer revert with `IncorrectASPRoot`. Pools that share an entrypoint with a Brevis pool now build their ASP root from Brevis's leaves as well as 0xbow's

## [2.16.0] - 2026-09-22

### Added

- Custom RPC endpoints, one per network, configurable before sign-in
- Sign in with a recovery phrase, without a wallet
- A price freshness countdown on the withdraw review step

### Changed

- With at least one custom endpoint configured, networks left unset are excluded from the account scan rather than served from the defaults. The form lists them before saving; clearing every endpoint restores the previous behaviour
- The default log range for a custom endpoint is 500,000 blocks, with a smaller range retained for providers documented to cap lower
- The withdraw form requests the price at review and the fee commitment at confirm
- The recipient is sent at review only to relayers that require it
- Wallet balance reads use a single fixed interval
- Event dates come from the bulk scan, and relay confirmation from block data

### Fixed

- Pool amounts are denominated from the pool asset's configuration rather than the wallet balance query, so formatting, parsing and proof inputs agree while that query is unresolved
- Dialogs taller than the viewport scroll to their controls
- The custom RPC form lays its endpoints out side by side
- Block timestamps are completed for chains scanned through a custom endpoint

### Notes

- Account discovery issues a large number of requests. A rate-limited endpoint can take considerably longer on first load; the form notes this

## [2.15.1] - 2026-09-11

### Changed

- The withdraw form works from data the app already has and computes what it needs locally
- One response under 100KB replaces roughly fifty, and several hundred KB

## [2.15.0] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- Account approval is derived from the ASP leaf set the client already downloads, rather than a second per-account request returning the same verdict
- The withdraw form computes its anonymity figure locally from shared pool feeds instead of fetching it per amount, so typing issues no requests
- A failed or empty approval snapshot is treated as unavailable rather than as a review verdict, and both configured sources must resolve before status updates
- Deposit pagination rejects duplicate, malformed and inconsistent pages instead of accepting a partial list, and fetches in small concurrent batches
- The legacy status lookup runs only from the explicit migration action
- Outgoing error reports carry fixed messages and boolean flags
- Recipients resolve locally

### Notes

- The status chip no longer separates the two non-approved states
- The anonymity figure reads unavailable until the deposits feed carries review data

## [2.14.10] - 2026-09-09

### Security

- Bumped Next.js 15.5.23 -> 15.5.25, patching two critical unauthenticated remote-code-execution advisories fixed in 15.5.24: GHSA-2xp9-vwfh-vxw4 (Image Optimization API, via AVIF files) and GHSA-p293-qw3h-jr36 / CVE-2026-75604 (windows-hosted servers). Dependency change only, no source changes

## [2.14.9] - 2026-08-12

### Security

- Bumped Next.js 15.5.18 → 15.5.23, patching the seven advisories fixed in 15.5.21: two high-severity SSRF issues (Server Actions on custom servers, rewrites via attacker-controlled destination hostname), two DoS issues (Server Actions in App Router, Image Optimization API via SVGs), two response-body cache-confusion issues, an unbounded Server Action payload on the Edge runtime, and unauthenticated disclosure of internal Server Function endpoints

## [2.14.8] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Adjusted SDK concurrency

## [2.14.7] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Fixed envio sync issues
- Bumped SDK version to increase requests timeouts

## [2.14.6] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Fixed envio sync issues

## [2.14.5] - 2026-08-04

### Security

- Pinned all dependencies to exact versions (removed the four remaining caret ranges) so package.json can never float onto a freshly published release
- Enforced a 7-day minimum release age for dependency resolution (`minimumReleaseAge: 10080`, own `@0xbow/*` packages exempt) in response to the Aug 4 Shai-Hulud npm supply-chain attack — audited the tree and confirmed the app was not affected
- Pinned pnpm to 10.34.5 via the packageManager field and moved CI off pnpm 9, which still ran dependency lifecycle scripts on install; pnpm 10 blocks them, closing the preinstall-script attack vector

## [2.14.4] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Replaced `bytesToNumber` with `bytesToBigInt` in the Privacy Pools SDK, restoring full 256-bit entropy for all newly generated keys and ensuring new accounts carry the full cryptographic security guarantees intended by the original specification

## [2.14.3] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- Global activity pages no longer get stuck on "No activity found" with the pager reading "4 OF 0" after a transient API failure — the table's loading/error state now tracks the paginated query itself (it previously tracked only the first-page preview), failures show a "Couldn't load activity." message with a Retry button, and navigating back to a failed page refetches instead of staying broken until a hard refresh
- Pagination is hidden when there are no items, so the "N OF 0" state can no longer appear while loading or after an error

## [2.14.2] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- Removed the FXN incentives badge (340% APR / Rollover / Incentives) from the fxUSD pool card; incentives are no longer running
- Simplified the withdraw modal title to "Withdraw"

## [2.14.1] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed

- Restored the relayer dropdown so users can pick between Fast Relay and Cloaked Relay (Fast Relay stays first)
- Display the selected relayer name as the fee collector in the withdrawal review modal instead of always showing `0xBow`
- Fixed a race in the relayer auto-select effect that caused Cloaked Relay to win the default slot when its `/details` endpoint responded faster than Fast Relay's
- Fall back to an ASP-derived per-token price when Alchemy doesn't return one, so withdrawal review modal and other surfaces stop showing `$0.00 USD` (and yield-bearing tokens like sUSDS show their actual price instead of a flat $1)
- Coerce Alchemy price values to a number (the API returns quoted strings) so the review modal no longer silently throws and shows `$0.00`
- Reset the quote, fee commitment and countdown when the user switches relayer in the withdraw form, so reopening the Review modal doesn't show stale data from the previous relayer

## [2.14.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added Cloaked Relay as a secondary mainnet relayer

### Changed

- Mainnet relayer list now preserves the order configured in `chainData` so Fast Relay stays first regardless of momentary price differences

### Fixed

- Fixed missing USD price for BOLD, sUSDS, USDe, frxUSD, fxUSD and yUSND pool stats. Live prices fall back to the ASP's reported pool USD value when Alchemy doesn't list the token, which also shows accurate prices for yield-bearing assets like sUSDS instead of pinning them at $1.

### Security

- Bumped Next.js to 15.5.18, picking up the 12 security advisories from the v16.2.6 release (Server Components DoS, middleware/proxy bypasses, WebSocket SSRF, CSP nonce XSS, Image Optimization DoS and RSC cache poisoning).

## [2.13.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- Migration banner and maintenance banner are now dismissible (with localStorage persistence)

### Fixed

## [2.12.0] - 2026-03-19

- Fixed target address not preserved when switching tokens in withdrawal form
- Show 'price unavailable' instead of blank when price fetch fails
- Added graceful fallback for unsupported extra gas on non-mainnet chains
- Replaced `bytesToNumber` with `bytesToBigInt` in the Privacy Pools SDK, restoring full 256-bit entropy for all newly generated keys and ensuring new accounts carry the full cryptographic security guarantees intended by the original specification
